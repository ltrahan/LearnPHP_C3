Review - Chapter 3

1. a form action tells where the information submitted should be used.

2. the method describes how to pass the data, either GET or POST. POST is more secure, GET would be used in the case that the resulting page might be something a user would bookmark.

3. The predefined variable is $_post.

4. So that the php script that gets loaded is also passed through a URL

5. Enabling display_errors in the script will not work when, due to other reasons, the webpage breaks and the script doesn't get a chance to run.  You do not use display_errors on a live site simply because it gives away too much information to the public.


For PURSUE I have two files:

registrations.html  which is a html page with a form that calls handle_registrations.php.  The script uses the $_POST variables to look up course details from a two dimensional array and display the.  It also uses an if statement to determine what payment message to display depending on the choice made on the form.
